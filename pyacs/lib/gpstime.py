GPS Time Utility functions

This file contains a Python implementation of GPS related time conversions.

The two main functions convert between UTC and GPS time (GPS-week, time of
week in seconds, GPS-day, time of day in seconds).  The other functions are
convenience wrappers around these base functions.  

A good reference for GPS time issues is:
http://www.oc.nps.navy.mil/~jclynch/timsys.html

Note that python time types are represented in seconds since (a platform
dependent Python) Epoch.  This makes implementation quite straight forward
as compared to some algorigthms found in the literature and on the web.

    This is based on the following facts (see reference above):

    GPS time is basically measured in (atomic) seconds since 
    January 6, 1980, 00:00:00.0  (the GPS Epoch)
    
    The GPS week starts on Saturday midnight (Sunday morning), and runs
    for 604800 seconds. 

    Currently, GPS time is 13 seconds ahead of UTC (see above reference).
    While GPS SVs transmit this difference and the date when another leap
    second takes effect, the use of leap seconds cannot be predicted.  This
    routine is precise until the next leap second is introduced and has to be
    updated after that.

    SOD = Seconds of Day
